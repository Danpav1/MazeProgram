This is a Maze solving / pathfinding program. It has some default mazes you can use or you can input your own. This program has different pathfinding algorithms you can choose and displays the run time for efficiency.

depth search: you go as deep as you can on a given path before choosing a new one.
breadth search: you search every neighbor of the node you are on.

 ### TO-DO ###
- add a GUI
    - turn the program into a downloadable exe file that is not machine dependent

- add depth first search algorithm
    - add breadth first search algorithm
        -add A* search algorithm

- add a slow down feature that when pressed adds a delay to the printing of the path
